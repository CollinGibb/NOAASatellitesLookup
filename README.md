# NOAASatellitesLookup
C++ Code that will allow users to lookup data about different satellites owned/ran by NOAA

The program I have created for my sample of work allows users to search for information about different satellites owned or managed by NOAA by entering the satellite's name when prompted. The program then displays key orbital data, launch info, ownership, and activity status for the satellites. To use the program please visit the GitHub page bellow to access the code. This code can be run in any C++ compiler and make sure to enter the satellite name exactly as listed.
